  **Jonesco, but more shiny **

  Our big blue logo is widely recognised internationally, so we wanted to keep it. What we’ve done is introduce an exciting new colour pallet and visually segmented our products into distinct ranges. From the outset we wanted to make things easier for you, and we think the changes we’ve made will make a huge difference to your browsing experience and allow you to see our complete ranges more distinctly.  

   

  **A website to end all websites **

  That’s a bold subheading, we know, but we’ve been working on our brand-new website for some time now and we’re really pleased with it. The first thing you’ll notice is that it’s quite the upgrade, we have movement, colour and shazam- but as they say, looks aren’t everything, it’s what’s inside that counts. 

  Now you can easily browse our ranges and access technical information more quickly through product tables, we’ve also developed two awesome search functions; a site wide search which will make getting to the product you want a doddle, and a smart mudguard search which will make filtering through our extensive range of sizes and finishes a breeze.  

  And if that wasn’t enough, we’ve been developing a new customer only area which we call ‘Download Centre’. Download Centre is a one stop shop for high-res product images, technical data sheets, product leaflets and more… We’ve already started activating customer accounts, so you should expect your unique log-in details to be with you very soon.  

   

  **What do you think? **

  We really hope you enjoy browsing our new site, it’s still early days but we’d love to hear what you think, help us improve things by leaving your feedback here, we’d really appreciate it! Oh, and if you need any help navigating the site simply get in touch with us, our people are always on hand to help you ace it.---
