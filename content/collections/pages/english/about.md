    introduction: 'Having spotted a gap in the market Mr Jones founded Jonesco for the manufacture and sale of steel mudguards.  By mid-to-late 70s we were in full ‘rock n roll’ mode with the introduction of plastic mudguards all thanks to the bespoke rotational moulding machines. As we delved deeper into rotational moulding we soon became experts, ultimately paving the way to today’s success and expansion into the fire, environmental and storage industries.'
