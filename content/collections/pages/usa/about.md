    introduction: 'Having spotted a gap in the market Mr Jones founded Jonesco for the manufacture and sale of steel mudguards.  By mid-to-late 70s we were in full ‘rock n roll’ mode with the introduction of plastic mudguards all thanks to the bespoke rotational moulding machines. As we delved deeper into rotational moulding we soon became experts, ultimately paving the way to today’s success and expansion into the fire, environmental and storage industries.'

      Safe in the hands of the Jones family we continue to grow and develop with pride, especially when we see Jonesco products in use across the globe.  
      We are proud of our family ties, not only with the legacy of the Jones family, but also many other family connections working within the business.  Our people are what make Jonesco and with a higher that average length of service we hope our employees are proud too.
