    title: 'Our Approach'
    text: |-
      Jonesco is a family company established in 1967 with global growth ambitions, as such we work around the clock to make sure that business is flowing smoothly. 

      We know we have a wider responsibility.  Never has it been so critical to make sure that whilst production and innovation continues, we persist in doing what we can to minimise our impact on the planet whilst also promoting social and environmental wellness.

      To make sure we’re following through with our environmental commitments, we operate under high standards set by The British Standards Institution. 
        
      We meet the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Standard, this means we make commitments to reduce pollution, prevent contamination and actively monitor all business activities which may have a detrimental impact on the environment. 
        
      In 2018 we voluntarily signed up to a Climate Change Agreement via The British Plastics Federation, meaning we are now subject to energy efficiency targets. 
        
      Most recently, we signed up to Operation Clean Sweep, this means  we’re committed to do everything we can to help reduce the loss of plastic pellets and powders to the environment.

    title: 'Plastic is Good'
    text: |-
      When used to excess, plastic (specifically single use plastic) can have a detrimental effect on the environment, but here at Jonesco we don’t manufacture single use plastic. 

      We manufacture hard wearing, high quality, long-term use plastics which are fully recyclable and carry many other benefits, such as; 

      - Fully recyclable 
      - Requires less heat than metal or glass during shaping 
      - Our plastic products are lighter than metal or glass alternatives, meaning less resources are used when shipping them 
      - Owing to their lightness, commercial vehicles fitted with our products burn less fuel than they would if they were they equipped with the metal, glass or wooden alternatives 
      - We have an extensive range of products aimed at ensuring industry comply with environmental standards, owing to its toughness plastic is the best way to ensure industry keep pollution levels and spill risks to an absolute minimum

    title: '100% Recyclable'
    text: |-
      All Jonesco manufactured products are 100% recyclable. Which explains why our waste figures are so low, we ensure that as little polymer goes to waste as possible, meaning all products that fail to meet our high standards are chipped and remoulded.   
        
      We’re also encouraging our distributors to pass on the message, so industry know that at the end of a Jonesco products life, they can dispose of it in a responsible, low impact way.

    title: 'Process Efficiency'

      We drive efficiency daily. 

      In order to get the most out of our products, we continually look at ways to improve our power, process and waste efficiencies. 

      Over recent years, the deployment of new technologies has helped us adapt and develop the way we mould, this means the products we make are both higher in quality and lower in environmental impact.

    title: 'Lowering our Footprint'
    text: |-
      Lowering your carbon footprint, it’s a phrase which is said all to often, but we at Jonesco have started to take some serious steps with the aim of offsetting the carbon release for which industry is responsible.   

      - Reducing or removing completely the use of single use plastics for packaging. 
      - Mixed recycling points spread across our three sites.  
      - LED lighting replacement programme.  
      - Solar Panel programme to help generate 350,000 kW/h  of energy per year (that’s enough to power almost 100 UK homes for one whole year!)

      We’ve installed over 1,200 solar power modules at our Preston production facility will generate almost 350,000kWh of power per year. 

      We’ve done the maths, and we’ve calculated that in year one, we’ll have reduced our CO2 output by more than 82 tonnes... (that’s 82,992.5 kg to be precise).
