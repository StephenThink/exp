    name: 'Henry Jones'
    job_title: 'Joint Managing Director'
    about: |-
      Henry is the Joint Managing Director at Jonesco, alongside his brother Andrew, and has worked here for over 34 years. 

      Henry heads up the group, which includes Jonesco France and having 15 direct reports certainly keeps him on his toes.  Many of his previous operational responsibilities have now been delegated to his son Ben, albeit begrudgingly, as he likes to keep close to the action.

      In his spare time, Henry enjoys clocking up the miles on gruelling bike rides around the Lancashire coast and countryside.  He also has a passion for sailing, especially around the Greek islands.
