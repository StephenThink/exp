    body: |-
      **1.1 Email Subscription**
      To subscribe to our email mailings, you may choose to provide Jonesco some relevant information. The personal information you may include will be your email address, first name, last name, country, company affiliation and product interests you would like to hear about from us. We only require a first name for email personalisation, an email address to send it to, and a country so we don’t send you irrelevant information for your part of the world.
      We use this information in co-operation with MailChimp, as a 3rd party data processor, to provide us with email marketing services. Information you submit will be maintained within MailChimp’s own database.
      Once subscribed you will receive periodic emails that correspond to your email interests when you signed-up to the service.
      When you subscribe to our email mailings MailChimp automatically notes your IP address as a record of consent. An email data source may be recorded if we have added your email from another consent source that we need to maintain for our own records.
      Alternatively, for existing customers we may occasionally send you marketing information where we have assessed that it is beneficial to you and in our interests to contact. Such information will be non-intrusive and is processed on the grounds of legitimate interest. In addition to the above collected information we may utilise prior purchasing preferences to only send you relevant information. Where used, we evaluate legitimate interest with a thorough legitimate interest assessment (LIA).

      **1.2 Contact forms and emails**
      If you choose to correspond to us via email, either directly or through our contact-us web-form, no data is stored on our website or shared to our 3rd parties (section 2.0). We only retain emails on our systems for as long as required in our retention policy.
      Should you check the box to consent (opt-in) for selected product news and developments we shall add your email to our MailChimp email platform on your behalf to provide you with that service.
      If your contact involves confidential or private information we advise you to send encrypted files with the access password(s) sent separately through alternate means of communication.  

      **1.3 Analytics**
      Like most websites, Jonesco’s sites uses Google Analytics(GA) to track user interaction. This allows us to determine the number of visitors using our site, how they came across our site, and what pages they view whilst on our website.
      We opt to use anonymised IP addresses, where the last two octets are zeros, for a higher level of visitor privacy in our analytics. This still does allow us to roughly geolocate our website user traffic, so we can view visitors by country for instance. There is also basic information collected such as browser type, device information and language which is aggregated into statistics. We use this information to evaluate and improve the services we offer. Google has developed an addon for use to opt-out of GA data collection.
      For related information please see the ‘cookies’ section (1.5) within this document.

      **1.4 Server Logs**
      When you view our content provided by Jonesco, we automatically collect and store information in server logs. These logs can include your web request, IP address, browser type, operating system, user-agent-string, web referrer.
      The sole purpose of this information being collected is for network and information security. This is a legitimate interest to permit the lawful processing of such data (GDPR Recital 49).

      **1.5 Cookies**
      Jonesco and our trusted partners use this technology to collect and store information which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.

      MailChimp also makes use of cookies both within our email campaigns to subscribers and to aid the functionality of subscription forms and pop-up forms. Within our email campaigns MailChimp uses ‘web-beacons’ which track email opening rate and what links are clicked on. MailChimp reports on this data so we can continuously improve our user interaction. More information can be found within MailChimp’s own cookie policy.
      If you would prefer not to store cookies on your machine you can alter your browser controls to reject cookies.

    heading: '3.0 How long is my data stored?'
    body: |-
      Jonesco will only ever retain personal information for as long as necessary and in accordance to our review and retention policies that are in place. 
      In relation to our market mailing we keep your data for as long as you are still an active subscriber to keep in contact and provide you with that service. We do occasionally delete email and related data if no market preference for mailings has been selected. Bounced email addresses are automatically cleaned from our list as an anti-spam filter prevention. 
      Basic individual data is retained solely for suppression purposes to prevent further unwanted processing when you unsubscribe from our marketing lists. This is carried out with consideration to legal obligations and a legitimate interest of both Jonesco and the individual in maintaining and upholding individual rights.
